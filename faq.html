            <h1>Color Communication (Anticipated) FAQ</h1>

            <span class="anchor" id="how-does-cc-help"></span>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>How does color communication improve accessibility for people with disabilities?</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        Color communication was originally designed for autistic people. It helps in several ways. First, it makes subtle social-contextual cues more explicit, which helps people who worry about misreading a situation, and does so in a way that does not require talking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It provides an easy way of setting up boundaries. With color communication, one can say, "Just because I was talking to my friend, that does not mean I want to be surrounded with more conversation," or "Just because I'm <em>not</em> starting up a conversation doesn't mean I don't want to."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can also help people cope with sensory overload without necessarily having to leave. If a person is becoming overwhelmed from all of the sound from conversations, they can switch to red for a while and take a break from interaction to regain energy for later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Color communication can also help people with social anxiety for similar reasons. It can decrease the fear of "maybe they don't want to talk to me," as well as give the person control over their interactions to avoid situations they were not prepared for or cannot handle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can also help people with ADHD: interruptions while working may be difficult to recover from, so color communication can help ensure that these interruptions are minimal. It can also be useful in situations that are too distracting to have a productive conversation—a person can say "if it's important, let's find somewhere else to talk."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is, of course, not an exhaustive list; it is just a few of the most salient examples.

                <h2>Wouldn't it make more sense for people to only use this if they have a relevant disability?</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        Not especially. In reality, <strong>that would make it much harder for people who need it for disability reasons to access it.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why? There is unfortunately a great deal of stigma surrounding disability. Saying that color communication should only be used by people with disabilities is requiring people to disclose their disability in order to use it, whether or not it is safe to do so. In contrast, making the use of color communication into the norm for a situation gives the choice back to the disabled person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also important to consider that many people who would need to use color communication <strong>would also benefit from knowing <em>others'</em> statuses,</strong> for the purpose of knowing when it is best to initiate a conversation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plus, there are plenty of reasons you might find it useful that are completely unrelated to disability.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>But if I'm not disabled, wouldn't I be taking resources from someone who needs them more?</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        Nope, you would actually be <strong>helping people access resources they need!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The three main resources that make color communication work are: paper, respect, and accessibility. If you are concerned about the paper, consider making it an even trade by skipping about two pages of printing or making an effort to reuse scrap paper for notes today. Luckily, the other two are not at all endangered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But even beyond that, using color communication (or almost any accessibility aid) broadly and beyond its originally indented use is actually a way of making it more available for people who need it for its intended purpose. This idea, known as <strong>the curb cut effect</strong>, comes from early in the disability rights movement, when wheelchair users were advocating for curb cuts—the dips in the sidewalk that make it so that one can get on without having to step up. As the prevalence of curb cuts grew, people noticed that they also made life a lot easier for bicyclists, people pushing strollers or shopping carts, etc. Seeing the breadth of the utility of curb cuts, people became more enthusiastic about installing them, <strong>thus improving access for wheelchair users and others with physical disabilities.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same principle applies here. If non-disabled people use color communication, talk about it with others who might find it helpful, and regard it as generally beneficial, then it will likely spread, allowing more disabled people to use it for its original purpose too.

                        In short, you don't. But why not give someone the benefit of the doubt?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an academic situation, for example, chances are a person is there with the intent to get the most out of it. It is also extremely likely that the person knows their own needs best. Wearing a red badge might decrease an overwhelming fear of being called on without warning in class to a more manageable level, allowing them to actually concentrate on the content. Or, a person with a chronic illness who felt too sick to come to class may find that they can as long as color communication allows them to keep to themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you think a person is using yellow or red more often than you expect or would like, it might be best to start by considering why they might be using it. Is there a problem with the environment that could be addressed (e.g., lots of noise, bright lights)? Is the structure of the situation potentially problematic (e.g., fast-paced discussions, group work)? If you feel it would be appropriate, you could talk to the person when they are on green, or send an email, to ask if there is anything that can be done to make the situation more accessible. Alternatively, you might consider trying to set up environments to be broaadly accessible by default whenever you have the power to do so. For example, if you are an intructor or otherwise leading a group, you might establish explicit blanket policies allowing anyone to use AAC for discussions, take breaks as needed, stim, or anything else that would make things more conducive to full participation.

                        It doesn't have to. It is probably much more likely that it means "I am very busy" or "I am in a hurry."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if it does mean something more along the lines of social exhaustion or distress, it could be a proactive measure. That is, a person might be using it to <em>avoid</em> a meltdown so that with some time they can get back to yellow or green.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Likewise, just because someone has used it due to something like anxiety before does not mean that is why they are using it now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The beauty of color communication is that <strong>the response is the same regardless of the reason</strong>, and so you do not need to share your reasons with anyone if you do not want to.

                <h2>Why do you keep saying "autistic person" or "disabled person"? Aren't you supposed to use person-first language?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes, person-first language is preferred. <strong>But it is not actually a universal preference.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://autisticadvocacy.org/home/about-asan/identity-first-language/" target="_blank">This article</a> does a good job of explaining the autistic community's preferences for identity-first language, but the condensed version is this: Referring to autism as separable from the self emphasizes the negative perceptions—this is not done to positive or even neutral traits. (Would you say "a person with Catholicism" or "an individual who has womanhood?") It downplays the extent to which one's experiences are shaped by being autistic and instead connotes that any positive experiences happen in spite of one's autism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to "disabled people" vs. "people with disabilities," there is not really an overarching preference across all self-advocates, and so I and many others tend to switch back and forth based on what makes the most sense in the context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most important part is to <strong>respect the people you are referring to.</strong> So when it comes to an individual, you should use the individual's preference (if they have one), and when you're talking about a group, you should use the group's preference.
