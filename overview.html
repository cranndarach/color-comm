                        Color communication is a way of communicating how open you are to interaction in a way that is clear and does not require talking. It is a system of badges that comes from the autistic community: it was first introduced by <a href="http://autismnetworkinternational.org" target="_blank">Autism Network International</a> (warning for eye strain on the linked page) and is commonly used at conferences and other autistic spaces. Learn more about the original uses of color communication <a href="http://autisticadvocacy.org/2014/02/color-communication-badges/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The point is to make it so that people can feel comfortable with the social environment.</strong> Some people would love to talk but may have trouble initiating or guessing if the other person wants to talk. Other people are easily overwhelmed by crowds and need a way to avoid having to talk to anyone they don't know. Sometimes people are just in a hurry and can't stop and chat. All of these are reasons to use color communication!

                    <h3>Absolutely!</h3>
                    <p>
                        Color communication is not only for autistic people or others with disabilities that that impact social interaction, nor is it only useful at conferences. It can be helpful in any situation where people are likely to interact with each other: classrooms, dorm rooms, offices, meetings, your living room, even the grocery store, to name a few.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's also not rude or anything like that to use something that was created with autistic people in mind if you're not autistic yourself. <strong>In fact, the more broadly it is used, the easier it will be for people with relevant disabilities to access it.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if an entire dorm is using color communication for the purpose of establishing healthy boundaries, then an autistic person who feels they would benefit from it would not have to worry about how to correctly explain it to all of their floormates, or a person with social anxiety would not have to publicly disclose in order to use it. This is known as the <a href="http://autisticadvocacy.tumblr.com/post/81713578745/overtflannel-exaltedreviewaverse" target="_blank">curb cut effect</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But as cool as it is to help other people, you can still find it useful even if you are not disabled (or, not in a way that is specifically relevant to social interaction).
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Let's say you're working among other people, but what you're working on is not too urgent and it would be fine for anyone to stop by if they have a question or just want to chat. <strong>You might put a "green" card on your door (or desk, self, etc.).</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Or, you're working on something that takes a fair bit of energy, but it's not due for a little while. Maybe an interruption would be okay, as long it's important. <strong>You would probably set the card to yellow.</strong> That way, you don't have to worry about the potential awkwardness of, "Is it important? Can it wait?"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Now, suppose you have a huge project due in an hour, and you know you will be working up until the last minute. The only reason you would tolerate an interruption is for someone to alert you to an imminent apocalyptic-scale disaster. <strong>You might set the card to red</strong> so people know to leave you alone.
                        </li>
