                        This is a sheet of paper that has a brief explanation of the meaning of each color, a place for your name (for shared spaces), and space at the bottom where you can mount the cards. It is recommended that you either print this on card stock, or print it on normal paper and laminate it or put it in a protective sleeve. Remember to make it possible for people to write their name on it!

                        The general badges, 3" x 4", two of each per page. It is strongly recommended that you print these on card stock, as they will be shifted around a lot. The tabs also make them easier to manipulate, especially for people with dyspraxia (common among autistic people) or other difficulties with motor control. These cards can go in a name tag holder, which can be attached to the door hanger with Velcro, tape, or glue, depending on how permanent you intend for it to be.

                    <p>
                        Note that the green is slightly blue-tinted to make them easier to distinguish for people who are colorblind (particularly between red and green). If you make changes, please make sure to keep it colorblind-accessible.

                        These are double-sided tent-fold cards. Each card is made of a half-sheet of cardstock, and they are folded (not cut!) along the dotted line. The idea is that these can be stacked such that the applicable one is on top. The double-sidedness makes it so that people can still see it whether they are sitting next to you or across from you. The tabs, again, make them easier to manipulate and know which one your are grabbing. They are easy to fold up and put in a notebook or folder (or maybe a pocket, if you're careful), making them convenient for people whose workspaces tend to move.

                        Personal preference will be a major factor in people's choice to wear color communication badges. The basic badges are provided here, but you may wish to think about the circumstances (Is it a conference or other short event? Or will people be wearing them on a long-term day-to-day basis?) and consider alternatives, or allow people to come up with their own ideas. Some people may be perfectly happy to wear a clip or lanyard with 3" x 4" badges in it, but others may find it cumbersome, or even feel that it creates an unfavorable sensory environment. You will definitely want to avoid forcing people to wear something that they are uncomfortable with (especially on low-spoon days).

                        These are the same as the door cards (above). They will fit nicely in a name tag holder designed for 3" x 4" cards. You may wish to attach a clip or a lanyard to the holder. If using a lanyard, consider making it adjustable in length (or use decent quality string or a necklace cord and tie an adjustable knot). It is not adviseable to use a pin (unless it is for your own set and you are aware of the consequences), as people will not be very excited about poking holes in their clothing every day.

                    <h3>Ideas for modifications:</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are plenty of ways you could modify color communication in order to make it easier to wear. The thoughts here are just suggestions, not an exhaustive list.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Use smaller cards and a smaller holder (but make sure they're still big enough to see easily)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make them into a necklace using Shrinky Dinks or perler beads (or <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/159343456/communication-necklace-health-bar-silver">buy pre-made ones</a>).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Wristbands, earrings, headbands, hats, shirt(?!)...as long as people can see it when you want them to.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hopefully, this will be updated as new ideas emerge!
