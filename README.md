# Color Communication

Site containing information about Color Communication: what it is, how to use it, etc.

## Site content to come:

* Updated home page to act more as an annotated site map (current `index.html` will be moved to `overview.html`)
* When materials are ready, digital copies with instructions will be published here, along with how to get physical kits if you are at UConn
* Theme-switching and related accessibility options

## Contributing:

Information about contributing will be available when the project is a little more stable.

A variety of accessible themes will be a priority, and so templates will be made available when the overall style has been sorted out.
