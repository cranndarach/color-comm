                <h2>Tips and Reminders</h2>
                <h3>Things to keep in mind for using color comunication effectively</h3>
                <div class="content">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Even in cases where it's okay to talk to someone who is on yellow or red, you might notice that the interaction is still difficult for them. As long as you're respecting their boundaries, chances are that they're not upset with you. They may just be anxious, tired, distracted, or overloaded. Here are some options to consider for making it easier:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If they seem anxious to get back to work, <strong>try to make the interaction as quick as possible.</strong> What are the important parts? What can wait?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Be patient while they formulate thoughts.</strong> Any number of things might be getting in the way of someone finding the right words. Avoid talking more to fill the silence. Even if you feel you're providing helpful information, is probably going to be more distracting and make it even harder.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Offer to use an alternative form of communication.</strong> If someone is having trouble speaking, for example, they might have an easier time using an AAC app, signing, writing it down, etc., but they may be uncomfortable or unable to suggest it themselves.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Even if someone is not obviously stressed, it might be best to make any interactions with a person on yellow or red as quick as possible.
                        </li>
                        <!-- <li>
                            <strong>Not everyone will have a "red list" or a "yellow list."</strong> Don't worry if someone hasn't "added" you to theirs!
                        </li> -->
                        <li>
                            If someone says you can be on their "yellow list" or "red list," use this power responsibly! It is still likely to be a bad idea to strike up a long conversation about weekend plans with someone on red.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may find that you need to adjust the specifics to suit your own needs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For example, you might ask people not to email you in favor of talking even if you're on yellow, or to try to get your attention gently before jumping into a conversation when you're on red.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>It may be a good idea to take some time when starting to use color communication to talk to the people you interact with most about your preferences</strong> or to figure out how you'll discuss modifications that need to come up later.
                        </li>
